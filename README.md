# Planet Cluedo: Who is killing Mother Earth?

# Abstract
Today, climate change is one of the world's greatest challenges. Although this is a topic that is reiterated almost every day, it seems that little progress is made in terms of coming up with solutions, considering its gravity. One of the main causal factors for global warming is the inefficient use of the world's natural resources. In an effort to further the advancements in battling climate change, and inspired by the famous board game, Cluedo, we aim to reveal global warming's biggest perpetrators by performing an analysis of the data published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ([FAOSTAT](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home)). We believe that by doing so, we would potentially compel the identified culprits to boost their efforts in fighting climate change and generally increase public awareness of this topic.

# Research questions
- How has the world recenlty evolved in terms of factors that are relevant to climate change (agricultural activity, CO2 emissions, deforestation, etc.)?
- What countries are the biggest/smallest contributors to global warming?
