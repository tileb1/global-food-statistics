# Is humanity's gluttony killing the planet?

# Abstract
With rising life expectancies and a rapid increase in population across the globe, it is getting harder for humanity to sustain its nutritional needs. The inefficient upscale of food production is having a noticeable negative impact on the planet. Deforestation, increased livestock farming, and the excessive use of fertilisers, which are all related to food production, are the main causal factors behind rising emissions in greenhouse gasses and consequently, global warming. In an effort to further the advancements in battling climate change, we aim to reveal how food production and its necessary resources have evolved, and the relation to global warming. We will do so by carrying out an analysis of the data published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ([FAOSTAT](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home)). We believe that by doing so, we could potentially increase general public awareness of this topic and compel people to keep the stated issue in mind when acting as consumers.

# Research questions
- How has the world recenlty evolved in terms of factors that are relevant to agriculture and climate change (agricultural activity, CO2 emissions, deforestation, etc.)?
- What are the most popular food types (per country and overall) and their relative impact on CO2 emissions?
- What countries are the most/least efficient in terms of meeting their nutritional needs?
- How do countries collaborate in order to meet these needs?
- What realizable good practices exist in order to reduce the negative impacts of food production?

# Dataset
We will be using the provided [Global Food & Agriculture Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics) dataset. Since the dataset on Kaggle is already in a nice format and mostly cleansed, we do not expect to perform much pre-processing on the data. Additionally, the dataset comprises of a wide variety of information which means that rather than looking to enrich it we will have to decide on what subset of information to use. However, we do plan to make use of the CO2 emission targets set by members countries of COP15 and COP21 conferences to compare these with evolution of CO2 emissions cause by food production.

# Questions for TAs
- Does the project have to be solely about food? Or is our approach acceptable?
- Is it ok to make extensive use of the raw files made available in the data set?
- What exactly do you mean by descriptive analysis for milestone 2?
